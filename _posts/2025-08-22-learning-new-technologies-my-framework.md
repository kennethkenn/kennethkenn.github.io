I've learned Qt, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Kafka in the past year. Here's my systematic approach.

## The Framework

### Phase 1: Survey (1-2 days)

**Goal:** Understand what the technology does and why it exists.

**Actions:**
- Read official "Getting Started" guide
- Watch 1-2 intro videos
- Skim documentation table of contents
- Read "Why X?" blog posts

**Output:** Can explain the technology in 2 sentences.

### Phase 2: Tutorial Hell (3-5 days)

**Goal:** Build something that works.

**Actions:**
- Follow official tutorial
- Build the "Hello World" equivalent
- Deploy it somewhere
- Break it and fix it

**Output:** Working project you can demo.

### Phase 3: Deep Dive (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Understand core concepts.

**Actions:**
- Read key chapters of official docs
- Build a real project (not a tutorial)
- Read source code of popular libraries
- Join community (Discord, Reddit, Stack Overflow)

**Output:** Can solve real problems independently.

### Phase 4: Mastery (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Become an expert.

**Actions:**
- Contribute to open source
- Write blog posts/tutorials
- Answer questions on Stack Overflow
- Read advanced books

**Output:** Others ask you for help.

## Example: Learning Kotlin

### Phase 1: Survey
- Read: "Kotlin for Java Developers"
- Watched: "Kotlin in 100 Seconds"
- Learned: "It's Java with better syntax + null safety"

### Phase 2: Tutorial
- Built: Simple Android app
- Deployed: To my phone
- Learned: Coroutines, data classes, extension functions

### Phase 3: Deep Dive
- Built: REST API with Ktor
- Read: Kotlin stdlib source code
- Joined: Kotlin Slack

### Phase 4: Mastery
- Contributed: Fixed bug in Ktor
- Wrote: This blog post
- Answered: 20+ Stack Overflow questions

## Learning Resources by Type

### Documentation
- **Best:** Official docs (authoritative)
- **When:** Phase 1 & 3

### Video Courses
- **Best:** Udemy, Pluralsight, YouTube
- **When:** Phase 2 (hands-on learning)

### Books
- **Best:** O'Reilly, Manning, Pragmatic Bookshelf
- **When:** Phase 3 & 4 (deep understanding)

### Practice
- **Best:** Build real projects
- **When:** All phases

## Time Management

**Don't:**
- Try to learn everything at once
- Get stuck in tutorial hell
- Give up after one week

**Do:**
- Focus on one technology at a time
- Build projects, not just tutorials
- Commit to 30 days minimum

## Conclusion

Learning is a skill. Use a framework, be consistent, build projects.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Survey → Tutorial → Deep Dive → Mastery
- Build real projects, not just tutorials
- Teach others to solidify knowledge
- Focus on one technology at a time
